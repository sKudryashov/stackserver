# Intro
# -----
#
# We recognize that doing a coding exercise at a whiteboard during an
# interview is stressful and likely doesn't represent how you would do if you
# were to work on a problem in your own time, in a comfortable environment.
#
# Instead, we're asking you to do spend a few hours on writing a stack server
# that passes this test suite.
#
# We're always open to feedback about the exercise and the process as a whole.
# Please let us know if you have any ideas on how we can improve.
#
# If you have questions or get stuck during the exercise, please reach out to
# your interviewer on the private Slack channel that you received by email.
#
# Getting started
# ---------------
#
# You'll need Ruby 2.3.0 or greater. Consider rvm [https://rvm.io/] to get
# that installed. You can then run this test suite as follows:
#
#   $ ruby stack-test.rb
#
# If you want to run a specific test you can use -n, as follows:
#
#   $ ruby stack-test.rb -n test_single_request
#
# What to submit
# --------------
#
# If you write a single file, send us that. If there are multiple files, put
# them in a tarball or zipfile and send it along with instructions. Either
# way, make sure to write any required instructions in the email or a supplied
# README file.
#
# Please take platform into consideration when you write your build instructions.
# Most of us run Macs, but we can easily get access to Linux boxes if needed.
# If there's any doubt, you can always provide a docker file that we
# can load up to build and run your project.
#
# We kindly ask you not to post your solution online.
#
# What we look at
# ---------------
#
# Besides counting the number of tests that your server passes/fails, there is
# no easily quantifiable procedure to evaluating someone's code.
#
# We will look for correctness by running a more extensive test suite than
# this one; and, of course, by close code inspection. We pay attention to the
# potential for race conditions, busy loops, the exact order in which your
# server handles requests, performs stack operations, and issues responses. We
# look at how you structured the code and how easy or hard it is to
# understand.
#
# Finally: bad layout and indentation, lots of stale, unused, or commented out
# code, and trailing white space will make your code look unnecessarily bad.
# Conditional logging is encouraged. Spaghetti code is frowned upon. Aim for
# code that you would be proud to deploy to a live server.
#
# Stack server
# ------------
#
# Write a server that manages a LIFO stack, supporting push and pop
# operations. The server listens for requests from clients connecting over TCP
# on port 8080. The server should respond to the request and then close the
# connection.
#
# A push request pushes the given payload onto the stack. However, the stack
# can have no more than 100 items on it. Push requests for a full stack should
# block until stack space becomes available. (This is similar to how HTTP
# long-polling works.)
#
# A pop request returns the top item from the stack to the client. If the
# stack is empty, the pop request should block until an item becomes available
# on the stack. (This, again, is similar to how HTTP long-polling works.)
#
# Both push and pop requests should be served (and their associated stack
# operations performed) in the order in which they arrive fully. Note that
# this is not necessarily the order in which the server accepts TCP
# connections: some clients may be very slow to write their requests. Clients
# that connect later may 'overtake' slower clients that are still writing
# their request. Those fast clients should get their response before the slow
# clients.
#
# The server should not have to juggle more than 100 clients simultaneously.
# Additional client connections should be rejected by sending a single byte
# response indicating busy-state and then immediately disconnected. (Strictly
# speaking, this means that there is a very brief period during which the
# server is handling more than 100 simultaneous connections--but only long
# enough to dismiss those additional clients.)
#
# However, there is an exception to this rule. To prevent deadlock (eg, 100
# pop requests all waiting for a push request that is always rejected) the
# server must free up resources under specific conditions. If the server is
# already handling 100 connections and a new client tries to connect, it must
# disconnect the oldest client, provided their connection is older than 10
# seconds. The server should only disconnect an old client when provoked by a
# new incoming client connection that would otherwise have to be rejected. It
# should not just disconnect old clients for no reason.
#
# A push request format is as follows. The first byte is the header. The rest
# of the request is the payload. The most significant bit in the header byte
# is 0; the 7 remaining bits are the length of the payload, in bytes. (As
# such, the minimum size for a push request is 2 bytes: 1 header byte and 1
# payload byte. The maximum size for a push request is 128 bytes: 1 header
# byte and 127 payload bytes.)
#
# The format of a pop request is a single byte with the most significant bit
# set to 1. The rest of the byte is ignored.
#
# The format of a push response is 1 byte, all zeros.
#
# The format of a pop response is 1 header byte, with the most significant bit
# set to 0 and the rest of the payload indicating the payload size. The rest
# of the response is the payload indicated number of bytes of payload.
#
# The format of a busy-state response is 1 byte, value 0xFF.
#
# You have to assume little-endian byte ordering, the default on x86
# architectures. Bytes are sent in network order.
#
#
# Another simplifying assumption you get to make is that once you pop
# something off the stack, that's it. You don't have to put it back on the
# stack if it turns out you can't write the response to the client (for
# example, if they disconnected).
#
# You might find it useful to implement a listening socket on, say, port 8081
# that prints out the state of the stack (and other debugging info you might
# need) and then closes the connection. This is optional, of course.
#
# This test suite assumes the server starts out with an empty stack. If this
# test suite crashes you should restart the server before running the test
# suite again. You are welcome to modify the server to implement a reset code
# (probably by interpreting the otherwise ignored remaining 7 bits in a pop
# request). Alternatively, have the server listen on another port over which
# you can send reset commands in setup or teardown.
#
# The test suite will cleanly close all of its connections when the teardown
# runs after each test. Your code will need to account for, and cleanup closed
# connections. To do this in a POSIX world, you must attempt to read from the
# socket; if your read call returns 0, then the connection has been closed.
# See the man page on recv:
# http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/recv.2.html#RETURN_VALUE
#
# You conveniently--and falsely--get to assume (and need to ensure) that
# sockets are always closed completely. In other words, the client and the
# server will not close the socket only for reading or writing, while keeping
# the other half open. Phrased differently, if the return value of a read()
# call on a socket indicates that the connection is closed, you can assume the
# connection is also closed for writing. The inverse is true, also.
#
# This test suite is representative, but not comprehensive. We encourage you
# to write more tests, but this is not required.
#
# You are welcome to write this in the language of your choice! You should
# pick a language that you are very comfortable with; don't try an implemention
# in CuttingEdgeLanguage2000 just because you think it will impress us.
# We'd rather see a clean solution in BoringOldLanguage. You may use whichever
# libraries you wish, but please provide clear installation instructions.
